# HTML Semantic and Non-Semantic Elements Playground

Welcome to the **HTML Semantic and Non-Semantic Elements Playground** repository! This is a space where you can explore, experiment, and learn about the differences between semantic and non-semantic HTML elements. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the importance of semantic markup or an experienced developer looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository is here to help.
## Introduction

HTML provides a wide range of elements that can be used to structure and style web content. Among these elements, some are considered "semantic," meaning they convey meaningful information about the content they wrap, while others are "non-semantic" and are used for layout and presentation purposes. Understanding the distinction between these two types of elements is crucial for building accessible, maintainable, and SEO-friendly web pages.

This repository is designed to help you grasp the concept of semantic and non-semantic elements by providing practical examples and exercises.

## Usage

The repository contains a collection of HTML files, each focusing on different semantic and non-semantic elements. You can open these files in a text editor to examine the code and understand the differences.

Feel free to modify the HTML code, experiment with different elements, and observe how they affect the content structure and layout. Use the browser's developer tools to inspect and analyze the changes in the rendered page.

## Examples

The repository provides several examples to demonstrate the contrast between semantic and non-semantic elements. Some of the examples include:

- **Header and Navigation**: Explore the use of `header`, `nav`, and `div` elements for structuring page headers and navigation menus.

- **Article and Section**: Compare the `article` and `section` elements with generic `div` elements for organizing content.

- **Lists**: Investigate the semantic nature of `ul`, `ol`, and `dl` elements compared to using `div` for creating lists.

- **Footer**: See how `footer` and `div` elements differ when used for page footers.
